## Tasks & Requirement
If you want to do all tasks(except `sublime`) below, just run

    make

or do a specific task by run

    make <taskname1>[ <taskname2> <tasknameN> ...]

![screenshot](./screenshot.jpg)

- ### Task `vimrc`
    1. Requirements: `git`, `vim`
    2. Setup:

            make vimrc

    *After* **or** *Before* above, you can override the system vim with the new one installed by `homebrew`.(OS X only. This is optional, but recommended, because system vim can't use system clipbord via register `+`)

        brew install macvim --override-system-vim
    And then uncomment the new vim `PATH` in `zsh/zshrc`.

- ### Task `gitconfig`
    1. Requirement: `git`
    2. Setup:

            make gitconfig

- ### Task `astylerc`
    1. Requirement: `astyle`. If you have installed `astyle` and press `Q` in vim, astyle will be used to format the *C*, *C++*, *C#*, *Java* file.
    2. Setup:

            make astylerc

- ### Task `wgetrc`
    1. Requirement: `wget`
    2. Setup:

            make wgetrc

- ### Task `zsh`
    If you have installed new zsh(located at `/usr/local/bin/zsh`) by `homebrew`, and want to use it as **login shell** instead of the **old** system zsh(`/bin/zsh`), you have to add `/usr/local/bin/zsh` to your `/etc/shells` to make it to be **standard shell**.

        sudo su
        echo "/usr/local/bin/zsh" >> /etc/shells
        exit
    And then **uncomment** the new zsh `PATH` in `zsh/zshrc`.

    Otherwise, the setup will use system zsh.
    1. Requirements: `git`, `zsh`
    2. Setup:

            make zsh

- ### Task `sublime`
    If you use `Sublime Text 2`, this task will add user Preference for it, and also add a [`Monokai-custom`](https://github.com/Jeremial/sublime-monokai-custom) colorscheme which supports Markdown file highlight.
    1. Requirement: `git`, `Sublime Text 2`
    2. Setup: **bakup your preference file first!**

        If you are using OS X, just run

            make sublime

        If you are using Linux, set `SUBLIMEPATH` before make, e.g.

            SUBLIMEPATH=~/sublimetext2 make sublime

        After installing the preference, maybe you want to reset `font_face` and `font_size` to what you prefer in `Preference.sublime-settings`.
    3. Install sublime packages(optional). You can see what sublime packages I used in [SublimePackages.md](sublime/SublimePackages.md).

    If you use `VIM Mode` in Sublime Text 2 on OS X 10.8+, when you hold `j`, `l`, `i`, `k`, the cursor will not move `left` `right` `up` `down` continually like real VIM, the solution is below.

    > \# Mac OS X Lion introduced a new, iOS-like context menu when you press and hold a key  
    > \# that enables you to choose a character from a menu of options. If you are on Lion  
    > \# try it by pressing and holding down 'e' in any app that uses the default NSTextField  
    > \# for input.

    > \# It's a nice feature and continues the blending of Mac OS X and iOS features. However,  
    > \# it's a nightmare to deal with in Sublime Text 2 if you're running Vintage (Vim) mode,  
    > \# as it means you cannot press and hold h/j/k/l to move through your file. You have  
    > \# to repeatedly press the keys to navigate.

    > \# You can disable this feature for just Sublime Text 2 by issuing the following command  
    > \# in your terminal:

    >       defaults write com.sublimetext.2 ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false

    > \# Alternately, if you want this feature disabled globally, you can enter this:

    >       defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false

    > \# In either case you'll need to restart your computer for the change to take place.

    > \# Happy coding!
