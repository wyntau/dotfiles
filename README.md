## Tasks & Requirement
If you want to do all tasks(except `sublime`) below, just run

    make

or do a specific task by run

    make <taskname1>[ <taskname2> <tasknameN> ...]

![screenshot](./screenshot.jpg)

- ### Task `vimrc`
    1. Requirements: `git`, `vim`
    2. Setup:

            make vimrc

    After above, you can override the system vim with the one installed by `homebrew`.(OS X only. This is optional, but recommended, because system vim can't use system clipbord via register `+`)

        brew install macvim --override-system-vim

- ### Task `gitconfig`
    1. Requirement: `git`
    2. Setup:

            make gitconfig

- ### Task `astylerc`
    1. Requirement: `astyle`. If you have installed `astyle` and press `Q` in vim, astyle will be used to format the file.
    2. Setup:

            make astyle

- ### Task `wgetrc`
    1. Requirement: `wget`
    2. Setup:

            make wgetrc

- ### Task `zsh`
    If you have installed new zsh(installed in `/usr/local/bin/zsh`) by `homebrew`, and want to use it as **login shell** instead of the **old** system zsh(`/bin/zsh`), add `/usr/local/bin/zsh` to your `/etc/shells` to make it to be **standard shell**. Otherwise, the setup will use system zsh.

        sudo su
        echo "/usr/local/bin/zsh" >> /etc/shells
        exit
    1. Requirements: `git`, `zsh`
    2. Setup:

            make zsh

- ### Task `sublime`
    If you use Sublime Text 2, this task will add user Preference for it, and also add a [`Monokai-custom`](https://github.com/Jeremial/sublime-monokai-custom) theme which supports Markdown file highlight.

    1. Requirement: `git`, `Sublime Text 2`
    2. Setup: **bakup your preference file first!**

        If you are using OS X, just run

            make sublime

        If you are using Linux, set `SUBLIMEPATH` first. e.g

            SUBLIMEPATH=~/sublimetext2 make sublime

## What are required optionally
