## Tasks & Requirement
Available tasks:

- ### Task `vimrc`
    Requirements: `git`, `vim`

    *After* **or** *Before* above, you can override the system vim with the new one installed by `homebrew`.(OS X only. This is optional, but recommended, because system vim can't use system clipbord via register `+`)

        brew install macvim --override-system-vim
    And then add the new vim __PATH__ into your `$PATH`.

- ### Task `gitconfig`
    Requirement: `git`

    __What others maybe you should install?__

    - Kaleidoscope( _OS X only_ ) - an excellent difftool when input `git difftool`
    - git-extras - some useful tools for git, install from <https://github.com/tj/git-extras>( _Linux, OS X_ ) or

            # OS X only
            brew install git-extras

    - git-flow - a post about git-flow: [a-successful-git-branching-model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), install from <https://github.com/nvie/gitflow>( _Linux, OS X_ ) or

            # OS X only
            brew install git-flow

- ### Task `astylerc`
    Requirement: `astyle`. If you have installed `astyle` and press `Q` in vim, astyle will be used to format the *C*, *C++*, *C#*, *Java* file.

    __What others maybe you should install?__

    astyle

        # OS X only
        brew install astyle

- ### Task `sublime`
    Requirement: `git`, `Sublime Text 2`

    **bakup your preference file first!**

    If you use `Sublime Text 2`, this task will add user Preference for it, and also add a [`Monokai-custom`](https://github.com/Treri/sublime-monokai-custom) colorscheme which supports Markdown file highlight.

    After installing the preference, maybe you want to reset `font_face` and `font_size` to what you prefer in `Preference.sublime-settings`. Also you can see what sublime packages I used in [SublimePackages](sublime/README.md).

    If you use `VIM Mode` in Sublime Text 2 on OS X 10.8+, when you hold `h`, `l`, `j`, `k`, the cursor will not move `left` `right` `down` `up` continually like real VIM, the solution is below.

    > Mac OS X Lion introduced a new, iOS-like context menu when you press and hold a key
    > that enables you to choose a character from a menu of options. If you are on Lion
    > try it by pressing and holding down 'e' in any app that uses the default NSTextField
    > for input.

    > It's a nice feature and continues the blending of Mac OS X and iOS features. However,
    > it's a nightmare to deal with in Sublime Text 2 if you're running Vintage (Vim) mode,
    > as it means you cannot press and hold h/j/k/l to move through your file. You have
    > to repeatedly press the keys to navigate.

    > You can disable this feature for just Sublime Text 2 by issuing the following command
    > in your terminal:

    >       defaults write com.sublimetext.2 ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false

    > Alternately, if you want this feature disabled globally, you can enter this:

    >       defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false

    > In either case you'll need to restart your computer for the change to take place.

    > Happy coding!

- ### Task `zsh`
    Requirements: `git`, `zsh`

    If you have your own aliases, put them in `~/.zsh.alias`, zsh will load them automatically.

    __What zsh plugins are used default?__

    - git
    - git-extras
    - git-flow
    - brew
    - osx
    - sublime
    - z
    - colored-man
    - sudo
    - zsh-syntax-highlighting

    So, maybe you should install some of them to make full use of zsh.

- ### Task `tmux`
    Requirements: `git`, `tmux`

    tmux plugins
    - tpm
    - tmux-sensible
